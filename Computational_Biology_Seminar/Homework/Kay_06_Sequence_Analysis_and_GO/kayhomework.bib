  abstract = {Degradation rates of most proteins in eukaryotic cells are determined by their rates of ubiquitination. However, possible regulation of the proteasome's capacity to degrade ubiquitinated proteins has received little attention, although proteasome inhibitors are widely used in research and cancer treatment. We show here that mammalian 26S proteasomes have five associated ubiquitin ligases and that multiple proteasome subunits are ubiquitinated in cells, especially the ubiquitin receptor subunit, Rpn13. When proteolysis is even partially inhibited in cells or purified 26S proteasomes with various inhibitors, Rpn13 becomes extensively and selectively poly-ubiquitinated by the proteasome-associated ubiquitin ligase, Ube3c/Hul5. This modification also occurs in cells during heat-shock or arsenite treatment, when poly-ubiquitinated proteins accumulate. Rpn13 ubiquitination strongly decreases the proteasome's ability to bind and degrade ubiquitin-conjugated proteins, but not its activity against peptide substrates. This autoinhibitory mechanism presumably evolved to prevent binding of ubiquitin conjugates to defective or stalled proteasomes, but this modification may also be useful as a biomarker indicating the presence of proteotoxic stress and reduced proteasomal capacity in cells or patients.},

  abstract = {RHBDL4 is an active rhomboid that specifically recognizes and cleaves atypical, positively charged transmembrane endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) substrates. Interaction of valosin-containing protein (p97/VCP) and RHBDL4 is crucial to retrotranslocate polyubiquitinated substrates for ERAD pathway. Here, we report the first complex structure of VCP-binding motif (VBM) with p97 N-terminal domain (p97N) at 1.88\hspace{0.25em}{\AA} resolution. Consistent with p97 adaptor proteins including p47-ubiquitin regulatory X (UBX), gp78-VCP-interacting motif (VIM), OTU1-UBX-like element, and FAF1-UBX, RHBDL4 VBM also binds at the interface between the two lobes of p97N. Notably, the RF residues in VBM are involved in the interaction with p97N, showing a similar interaction pattern with that of FPR signature motif in the UBX domain, although the directionality is opposite. Comparison of VBM interaction with VIM of gp78, another {$\alpha$}-helical motif that interacts with p97N, revealed that the helix direction is inversed. Nevertheless, the conserved arginine residues in both motifs participate in the majority of the interface via extensive hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions with p97N. We identified novel VBM-binding mode to p97N that involves a combination of two types of p97-cofactor specificities observed in the UBX and VIM interactions. This highlights the induced fit model of p97N interdomain cleft upon cofactor binding to form stable p97-cofactor complexes. Our mutational and biochemical analyses in defining the specific interaction between VBM and p97N have elucidated the importance of the highly conserved VBM, applicable to other VBM-containing proteins. We also showed that RHBDL4, ubiquitins, and p97 co-operate for efficient substrate dislocation.},

  abstract = {The presenilin complex, consisting of presenilin, nicastrin, anterior pharynx defective-1 and presenilin enhancer-2, constitutes {$\gamma$}-secretase, which is required for the generation of amyloid {$\beta$}-protein. In this article, we show that Synoviolin (also called Hrd1), which is an E3 ubiquitin ligase implicated in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation, is involved in the degradation of endogenous immature nicastrin, and affects amyloid {$\beta$}-protein generation. It was found that the level of immature nicastrin was dramatically increased in synoviolin-null cells as a result of the inhibition of degradation, but the accumulation of endogenous presenilin, anterior pharynx defective-1 and presenilin enhancer-2 was not changed. This was abolished by the transfection of exogenous Synoviolin. Moreover, nicastrin was co-immunoprecipitated with Synoviolin, strongly suggesting that nicastrin is the substrate of Synoviolin. Interestingly, amyloid {$\beta$}-protein generation was increased by the overexpression of Synoviolin, although the nicastrin level was decreased. Thus, Synoviolin-mediated ubiquitination is involved in the degradation of immature nicastrin, and probably regulates amyloid {$\beta$}-protein generation.

  abstract = {The ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel controls insulin secretion by coupling glucose metabolism to excitability of the pancreatic beta-cell membrane. The channel comprises four subunits each of Kir6.2 and the sulphonylurea receptor (SUR1), encoded by KCNJ11 and ABCC8, respectively. Mutations in these genes that result in reduced activity or expression of K(ATP) channels lead to enhanced beta-cell excitability, insulin hypersecretion and hypoglycaemia, and in humans lead to the clinical condition congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI). Here we have investigated the molecular basis of the focal form of CHI caused by one such mutation in Kir6.2, E282K. The study led to the discovery that Kir6.2 contains a di-acidic ER exit signal, (280)DLE(282), which promotes concentration of the channel into COPII-enriched ER exit sites prior to ER export via a process that requires Sar1-GTPase. The E282K mutation abrogates the exit signal, and thereby prevents the ER export and surface expression of the channel. When co-expressed, the mutant subunit was able to associate with the wild-type Kir6.2 and form functional channels. Thus unlike most mutations, the E282K mutation does not cause protein mis-folding. Since in focal CHI, maternal chromosome containing the K(ATP) channel genes is lost, beta-cells of the patient would lack wild-type Kir6.2 to rescue the mutant Kir6.2 subunit expressed from the paternal chromosome. The resultant absence of functional K(ATP) channels leads to insulin hypersecretion. Taken together, we conclude that surface expression of K(ATP) channels is critically dependent on the Sar1-GTPase-dependent ER exit mechanism and abrogation of the di-acidic ER exit signal leads to CHI.},

In this study, we identified a multi-pass transmembrane protein, tumor suppressor activated pathway-6 (TSAP6) as a potential substrate of RHBDD1. RHBDD1 was found to induce the proteolysis of TSAP6 in a dose- and activity-dependent manner. The cleavage of TSAP6 was not restricted to its glycosylated form and occurred in three different regions. In addition, mass spectrometry and mutagenesis analyses both indicated that the major cleavage site laid in the C-terminal of the third transmembrane domain of TSAP6. A somatic cell knock-in approach was used to genetically inactivate the endogenous RHBDD1 in HCT116 and RKO colon cancer cells. Exosome secretion was significantly elevated when RHBDD1 was inactivated in the two cells lines. The increased exosome secretion was verfied through the detection of certain exosomal components, including Tsg101, Tf-R, FasL and Trail. In addition, the elevation of exosome secretion by RHBDD1 inactivation was reduced when TSAP6 was knocked down, indicating that the role of RHBDD1 in regulating exosomal trafficking is very likely to be TSAP6-dependent. We found that the increase in FasL and Trail increased exosome-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that RHBDD1 is involved in the regulation of a nonclassical exosomal secretion pathway through the restriction of TSAP6.},

  abstract = {ER{$\alpha$} positive breast cancer accounts for 70\% of breast malignancies. Compared with ER{$\alpha$} negative types, ER{$\alpha$} positive breast cancer could be effective controlled by endocrine therapy. However, more than half of the patients will develop endocrine resistance, making it an important clinical issue for breast cancer therapy. Endocrine resistance might be caused by multiple alternations, including the components of ER{$\alpha$} signaling, during tumor progression. Thus, it is urgent and necessary to uncover the molecular mechanisms that controls ER{$\alpha$} expression and stability to improve breast cancer therapeutics. In our current study, we identifies that the ubiquitin ligase RNF181 stabilizes ER{$\alpha$} and facilitates breast cancer progression. The expression of RNF181 is correlated with ER{$\alpha$} level in human breast tumors and relates to poor survival in endocrine-treated patients. RNF181 depletion inhibits breast cancer progression in vivo and in vitro, reduces ER{$\alpha$} protein level and its target gene expression, such as PS2 and GREB1. Unbiased RNA sequencing analysis indicates RNF181 is necessary for ER{$\alpha$} signature gene expression in whole genomic level. Immuno-precipitation assays indicate that RNF181 associates with ER{$\alpha$} and promotes its stability possibly via inducing ER{$\alpha$} K63-linked poly-ubiquitination. In conclusion, our data implicate a non-genomic mechanism by RNF181 via stabilizing ER{$\alpha$} protein controls ER{$\alpha$} target gene expression linked to breast cancer progression.},
