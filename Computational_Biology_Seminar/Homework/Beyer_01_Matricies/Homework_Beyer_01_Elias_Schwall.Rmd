## Bird problem
The bird problem can be described with the following linear equation system: $$b + 1 = (a-1)* 2$$ $$b - 1 = a +1$$ 
By ordering the equations, the system looks like this: $$-2a + b = -3$$ $$-a + b = 2$$ 
```{r Code, echo=T}
# the coefficients of the linear equation system can be stored in a matrix A
A <- matrix(c(-2, 1, -1, 1), nrow = 2, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
A
# the right hand side of the equation system can be stored in a vector B
B <- c(-3, 2)
B
# we know that A * X = B, so we can solve for X by multiplying both sides with the inverse of A
X <- solve(A) %*% B
X
```
Solution: On one table, there are 5 birds and on the other table, there are 7 birds.
